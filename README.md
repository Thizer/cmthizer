# CmThizer
Our pure simple CMS without database (based on markdown files)

As the others CMS systems are all too big and needs too much time to be configured we decided to build our own
**Content Management System** based only in _yml_ and _markdown_ files and without database. It's pure, it's simple and will be
great.

## Instalation
Instructions about how to install will be filled here as soon as possible.
